Please see [the main baad repo](https://github.com/dfalster/baad) for more information about baad; this repo and package is a simple tool to access the data there.

## Usage:


```r
baad <- baad.data::baad_data()
```

Then access the data with:

```r
head(baad$data)
```

To download a specific version:

```r
baad_090 <- baad.data::baad_data("0.9.0")
```

## Contents

The database contains the following elements

- `data`: amalgamated dataset (table), with columns as defined in `dictionary`
- `dictionary`: a table of variable definitions
- `metadata`: a table with columns "studyName","Topic","Description", containing written information about the methods used to collect the data
- `methods`: a table with columns as in data, but containing a code for the methods used to collect the data. See [config/methodsDefinitions.csv](config/methodsDefinitions.csv) for codes.
- `references`: as both summary table and bibtex entries containing the primary source for each study
- `contacts`: table with contact information and affiliations for each study
